prework module 2.3.6
# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

The motivation of this project is to familiarize myself with the four topics that were highlighted on the site. I built this assignment to get comfortable with coding languages. The problem that it solves would be that I would not be going into this not knowing how anything worked. I learned four languages and several skills- I have been introduced to how everything works.
